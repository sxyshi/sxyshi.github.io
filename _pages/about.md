I am a master's student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), majoring in Machine Learning since 2023. I work as a research engineer at KTH advised by [Sonia Horchidan](https://soniahorchidan.github.io/) and [Prof. Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc), focusing on the [Orb DB project](https://orbdb.github.io/) and Conformal Prediction for Graph Embedding Spaces. My research interests include Graph Representation Learning, and Graph Neural Networks.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) (HIT) in 2023. I was a research assistant at Massive Data Computing Center of HIT supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang). Additionally, I served as a research assistant at [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) supervised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/).
